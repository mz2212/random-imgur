# random-imgur

A program written in rust to fetch random images from imgur and display them with SDL2.  
Fair warning, imgur stores lots of NSFL/NSFW images. If you don't wish to potentially see these, leave now.

With a bit of work this could probably be adapted to other image hosts, if you know how their URLs are formatted and what the errors look like.
